# Phase 3: AI Chatbot with MCP Architecture - Additional Dependencies
#
# This file extends the base requirements.txt with Phase 3-specific packages.
# Install both: pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-phase3.txt
#
# Constitution: .specify/memory/phase-3-constitution.md (v1.1.0)
# Spec: specs/002-ai-chatbot-mcp/spec.md

# ===========================
# OpenAI Agents SDK
# ===========================
openai>=1.40.0  # OpenAI Agents API with function calling and MCP integration
tiktoken>=0.7.0  # Token counting for conversation context management (MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=8000)

# ===========================
# Model Context Protocol (MCP)
# ===========================
# Note: MCP SDK may not be available as a PyPI package yet
# If using custom MCP implementation, add path or Git URL here
# Example: mcp-sdk @ git+https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-python-sdk.git
#
# For now, we'll implement MCP tools as plain functions following the protocol spec
# No external MCP SDK dependency required (tools register directly with OpenAI Agents)

# ===========================
# Database (Shared with Phase 2)
# ===========================
# Already in requirements.txt:
# - sqlmodel>=0.0.16
# - psycopg[binary]>=3.2.0

# ===========================
# Testing (Additional for Phase 3)
# ===========================
pytest-cov>=4.1.0  # Code coverage reporting (≥85% target per constitution)
pytest-mock>=3.12.0  # Mocking for OpenAI API calls in unit tests
responses>=0.24.0  # Mock HTTP responses for integration tests

# ===========================
# Observability & Cloud-Native
# ===========================
python-json-logger>=2.0.7  # JSON structured logging for cloud platforms
# Circuit breaker pattern (custom implementation in utils/circuit_breaker.py)

# ===========================
# Development & Debugging
# ===========================
ipdb>=0.13.13  # Enhanced debugger for development
