## Prompt

do we need to update the all the claude.md files to match with the current status of the project

## Response snapshot

Analyzed the repository status and confirmed that CLAUDE.md was outdated. Updated the root CLAUDE.md to reflect the active branch (ui-ux-modern-redesign), today's date, and recently completed features like the professional dashboard transformation and auth stability fixes.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Project documentation is now accurate, ensuring future sessions have the correct context for running the app and understanding active development.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: CLAUDE.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Regular documentation maintenance is critical in a fast-moving project to prevent context drift between the AI and the actual source code.
